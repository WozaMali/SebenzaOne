# Image Loading Fix for Landing Site

## Problem
Images are not displaying on the deployed landing site, even though they exist in the public directory and build correctly.

## Root Cause
The issue is likely related to:
1. Vercel's static export configuration
2. Image path resolution in production
3. Missing proper headers for static assets

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Updated Next.js Configuration
- Removed custom image loader that might cause issues
- Ensured `unoptimized: true` for static exports
- Added proper `assetPrefix` and `basePath` settings

### 2. Enhanced Vercel Configuration
- Added explicit `outputDirectory: "out"` 
- Added proper headers for image files with caching
- Added rewrites to ensure proper routing

### 3. Added Error Handling
- Added `onError` handlers to all image elements
- Images will hide gracefully if they fail to load
- Console logging for debugging

### 4. Created Image Test Page
- Added `/image-test` route for debugging
- Shows loading status for all images
- Helps identify which images are failing

## Files Modified

### Configuration Files
- `next.config.js` - Updated image settings
- `vercel.json` - Enhanced deployment configuration

### Components
- `src/components/Hero.tsx` - Added error handling
- `src/components/GreenScholar.tsx` - Added error handling  
- `src/components/WozaMali.tsx` - Added error handling

### New Files
- `src/components/ImageTest.tsx` - Image testing component
- `app/image-test/page.tsx` - Test page route

## Testing Steps

### 1. Local Testing
```bash
cd landing-site
npm run build
npm run start
# Visit http://localhost:3000/image-test
```

### 2. Deploy to Vercel
```bash
# Commit and push changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix image loading issues"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Verify on Deployed Site
1. Visit your deployed site
2. Check browser console for any image loading errors
3. Visit `/image-test` to see detailed image status
4. Verify all images are loading correctly

## Troubleshooting

### If Images Still Don't Load

1. **Check Browser Console**
   - Look for 404 errors or CORS issues
   - Check network tab for failed requests

2. **Verify File Paths**
   - Ensure images are in `public/` directory
   - Check that filenames match exactly (case-sensitive)

3. **Check Vercel Deployment**
   - Verify build output includes images in `out/` directory
   - Check Vercel function logs for errors

4. **Test Direct Image URLs**
   - Try accessing images directly: `https://yourdomain.com/SNWG Soweto.jpg`
   - If this fails, there's a deployment issue

### Alternative Solutions

If the issue persists, try these alternatives:

1. **Use CDN for Images**
   ```jsx
   <img src="https://cdn.yourdomain.com/images/SNWG Soweto.jpg" />
   ```

2. **Import Images as Modules**
   ```jsx
   import heroImage from '/public/SNWG Soweto.jpg'
   <img src={heroImage} />
   ```

3. **Use Next.js Image Component**
   ```jsx
   import Image from 'next/image'
   <Image src="/SNWG Soweto.jpg" alt="..." width={800} height={600} />
   ```

## Expected Results

After implementing these fixes:
- ✅ All images should load correctly on the deployed site
- ✅ Images should have proper caching headers
- ✅ Error handling prevents broken image placeholders
- ✅ Test page shows detailed loading status

## Monitoring

1. **Check Image Test Page**: Visit `/image-test` regularly
2. **Monitor Console Logs**: Look for image loading errors
3. **Verify Performance**: Images should load quickly with proper caching

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the changes to Vercel
2. Test the deployed site thoroughly
3. Monitor for any remaining issues
4. Consider optimizing images for better performance
5. Set up monitoring for image loading failures
